CodeBook
The function code is heavily annotated to explain the flow of processing. Some steps were done out of the recommended assignment order. 
For example, after merging the two sets, descriptive column names were added before extracting the variable/columns with 
the desired measurements. At that point, the descriptive activity names were added. This process gave the same type of table 
expected in step 4 of the assignment before creating a second independent tidy data set for submission.
Descriptive variable names include the variable activity and direction, e.g. timedbodyacc.mean.x for mean timed body acceleration  on the x axis. For variables with "t" or "f", at the beginning of the name in the raw data, "timed or "frequency" was substituted.  All variable names are in lower case as recommended in lecture.  

All variables are derived from the original feature selection: "The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
