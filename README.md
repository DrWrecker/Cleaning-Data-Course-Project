Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Course Project

The tidydata file submitted follows the rules for tidy data: each
variable is in a column and each different observation is on a row. The names of the variables (column names) have been modified for clarity and adjusted with the make.names function to be "R valid". In addition, parentheses and dashes were removed to make the names easier to handle on the command line. The descriptive names are derived from the features_info.txt and features.tx files of the UCI HAR Dataset. The function code is heavily commented to describe the flow of the analysis.
